Sure! Let’s create a Dockerized version of your FastAPI application. We’ll follow these steps:

Create a Dockerfile: This file will define the environment and commands to set up and run your application.
Create a requirements.txt: This file will list all the dependencies required by your application.
Build the Docker image: Use the Dockerfile to build the image.
Run the Docker container: Start a container from the built image.
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Create a Dockerfile
Create a file named Dockerfile in the root of your project directory with the following content:

# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

2. Create a requirements.txt
Create a file named requirements.txt in the root of your project directory with the following content:

fastapi
uvicorn
python-jose
passlib[bcrypt]
redis
google-cloud-firestore
langchain
azure-search-documents
langchain-openai

3. Build the Docker Image
Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t ai-workflow .

4. Run the Docker Container
After building the image, you can run a container using the following command:

docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name ai-workflow-container ai-workflow

This command will start a container named ai-workflow-container and map port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on your host machine.

Summary
By following these steps, you can Dockerize your FastAPI application, making it easy to deploy and run in any environment that supports Docker. If you need further customization or have any questions, feel free to ask!
