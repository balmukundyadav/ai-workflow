I am streaming llm response with gpt-4o at certain point response got stop due to finish reason length, i would like continue response when length reason reached, could please write python code for the same 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You can handle this by detecting when the finish_reason is "length" and making a follow-up request to continue from where the response left off. Here’s a Python implementation using OpenAI’s API:

Implementation
python
Copy
Edit
import openai

def stream_llm_response(prompt, model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=1024):
    """
    Stream LLM response and handle continuation if stopped due to length.
    """
    full_response = ""
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

    while True:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            stream=True  # Enable streaming
        )

        chunk_text = ""
        finish_reason = None

        for chunk in response:
            if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.get("content"):
                text_part = chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]
                chunk_text += text_part
                print(text_part, end="", flush=True)  # Stream output live

            finish_reason = chunk.choices[0].finish_reason if chunk.choices else None

        full_response += chunk_text

        # If stopped due to length, continue response
        if finish_reason == "length":
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": chunk_text})
        else:
            break  # Stop if it's a normal completion

    return full_response

# Example Usage
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
response = stream_llm_response(prompt_text)
Explanation
The function makes an initial request to GPT-4o with streaming enabled.
If the response stops due to "length", it appends the partial response to the message history and continues generating more text.
This loop continues until the full response is obtained.
Let me know if you need modifications!







You said:
Will it continue to return chunk responses as well to client or only rerun full response at once
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The current implementation streams responses chunk by chunk to the client while handling the continuation seamlessly. It ensures that:

The response is streamed in real-time.
If the finish_reason is "length", a new request is made with the previous response as context, continuing the generation.
It continues streaming each chunk from the new request instead of waiting for the full response.
So, it does not rerun the entire response at once—it keeps streaming as new chunks arrive. Let me know if you need refinements!







You said:
Could you please make it similar to chatgpt how chatgpt handle such case on length 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To handle the response streaming like ChatGPT itself, you can modify the implementation to continuously request more tokens when finish_reason is "length", ensuring a seamless continuation. Below is an optimized version that maintains streaming behavior while handling token limits like ChatGPT.

Implementation (ChatGPT-like Handling)
python
Copy
Edit
import openai

def stream_llm_response(prompt, model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=1024):
    """
    Stream LLM response and handle continuation if stopped due to length.
    This function mimics ChatGPT's behavior by continuing until completion.
    """
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    full_response = ""

    while True:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            stream=True  # Enable streaming
        )

        chunk_text = ""
        finish_reason = None

        for chunk in response:
            if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.get("content"):
                text_part = chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]
                chunk_text += text_part
                full_response += text_part
                print(text_part, end="", flush=True)  # Stream to client in real-time

            finish_reason = chunk.choices[0].finish_reason if chunk.choices else None

        # If response stopped due to length, continue from where it left off
        if finish_reason == "length":
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": chunk_text})
        else:
            break  # Exit loop when response completes naturally

    return full_response

# Example Usage
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
response = stream_llm_response(prompt_text)
How This Works (Similar to ChatGPT Behavior)
Streams Response in Real-Time
Each chunk is printed live (print(text_part, end="", flush=True)).
Handles Token Limit Exceeding (finish_reason == "length")
If the response stops due to length, the assistant’s last response is stored in messages, and a new request is made to continue from where it left off.
No Repetition or Restart
The continuation starts exactly from the last point, avoiding re-generating previous text.
This closely mimics how ChatGPT itself handles long responses when streaming. Let me know if you need further refinements!







You said:
Here you are print chunks but what if client need to get chunks to display in ui
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the client needs to receive streamed chunks for UI display, you can use a Python generator. This allows real-time chunk delivery while handling continuation seamlessly, similar to ChatGPT.

Implementation: Stream Chunks to Client (Like ChatGPT)
python
Copy
Edit
import openai

def stream_llm_chunks(prompt, model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=1024):
    """
    Stream LLM response chunks to the client while handling length-based continuation.
    This mimics ChatGPT's streaming behavior.
    """
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

    while True:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            stream=True  # Enable streaming
        )

        chunk_text = ""
        finish_reason = None

        for chunk in response:
            if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.get("content"):
                text_part = chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]
                chunk_text += text_part
                yield text_part  # Send chunk to client UI in real-time

            finish_reason = chunk.choices[0].finish_reason if chunk.choices else None

        # If response stopped due to length, continue from where it left off
        if finish_reason == "length":
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": chunk_text})
        else:
            break  # Exit loop when response completes naturally

# Example Usage: Simulating client receiving chunks
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
for chunk in stream_llm_chunks(prompt_text):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)  # Simulating UI streaming display
How This Works
Uses yield to Stream Chunks
Instead of printing, it yields each chunk so the client can process it in real-time.
Handles Token Limit Exceeding (finish_reason == "length")
If the response stops due to length, it continues seamlessly.
Can Be Used in Web Frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django, etc.)
This function can be plugged into a FastAPI or Flask endpoint to stream responses to a front-end UI.
Example: FastAPI Endpoint to Stream Response
If you are building a web app, you can integrate this with FastAPI for real-time streaming:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/stream")
def stream_response(prompt: str):
    return StreamingResponse(stream_llm_chunks(prompt), media_type="text/plain")
Client-Side (JavaScript Fetch Example)
If your UI is in JavaScript/React:

javascript
Copy
Edit
async function fetchResponse() {
    const response = await fetch("/stream?prompt=Explain the theory of relativity");
    const reader = response.body.getReader();
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();

    while (true) {
        const { value, done } = await reader.read();
        if (done) break;
        console.log(decoder.decode(value)); // Append to UI
    }
}
Final Thoughts
This implementation is efficient, real-time, and seamless—it delivers LLM chunks without waiting for the full response, and continues automatically when length is exceeded.

You said:
Thanks, could you please rewrite the above code using langgraph 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Sure! Below is how you can implement streaming LLM responses with continuation using LangGraph. LangGraph helps manage control flow in multi-step interactions like handling LLM token limits.

Implementation Using LangGraph
This LangGraph-based solution:

Streams responses to the client in chunks.
Detects finish_reason == "length" and continues seamlessly.
Uses LangGraph’s state management to track and extend responses.

class ChatState:
    messages: list  # Store conversation history

# Define function to call LLM
def call_llm(state: ChatState):
    """
    Calls GPT-4o and streams responses, handling length-based continuation.
    """
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=state.messages,
        max_tokens=1024,
        stream=True,  # Enable streaming
    )

    chunk_text = ""
    finish_reason = None

    for chunk in response:
        if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.get("content"):
            text_part = chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]
            chunk_text += text_part
            yield text_part  # Stream chunk to client

        finish_reason = chunk.choices[0].finish_reason if chunk.choices else None

    # If response stopped due to length, continue
    if finish_reason == "length":
        state.messages.append(AIMessage(content=chunk_text))
        yield from call_llm(state)  # Recursively continue response

# Build LangGraph workflow

graph.set_entry_point("generate")

# Compile graph
executor = graph.compile()

# Function to start streaming response
def stream_response(prompt):
    """
    Initializes chat and streams LLM response in real-time.
    """
    state = ChatState(messages=[HumanMessage(content=prompt)])
    for chunk in executor.invoke(state):
        yield chunk  # Send chunk to UI

# Example Usage: Simulating client receiving chunks
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
for chunk in stream_response(prompt_text):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)  # Simulating UI streaming display
How This Works
Uses LangGraph to Manage State
Tracks conversation history (ChatState).
Streams Response in Real-Time (yield)
Chunks are sent to the client immediately.
Handles Length-Based Continuation (finish_reason == "length")
Automatically re-calls GPT-4o if the response cuts off.
Scalable for UI & Web Apps
Can be integrated with FastAPI for real-time streaming.
Example: FastAPI Streaming Endpoint
You can integrate this with FastAPI for a web-based chatbot.

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/chat")
def chat_stream(prompt: str):
    return StreamingResponse(stream_response(prompt), media_type="text/plain")
Client-Side (JavaScript UI Integration)
If using JavaScript (React/Vanilla JS):

javascript
Copy
Edit
async function fetchResponse() {
    const response = await fetch("/chat?prompt=Explain the theory of relativity");
    const reader = response.body.getReader();
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();

    while (true) {
        const { value, done } = await reader.read();
        if (done) break;
        console.log(decoder.decode(value)); // Append to UI
    }
}
Why Use LangGraph?
✅ Handles streaming & state tracking automatically.

You said:
Can you use MessageState that maintain conversation history provided by langgraph instead of ChatState , please ensure it should work if you are changing this
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes! I'll modify the code to use LangGraph’s built-in MessageState, which automatically maintains conversation history. This will ensure seamless response continuation when finish_reason == "length", just like ChatGPT.

Updated LangGraph Implementation Using MessageState
This version:
✅ Uses MessageState to maintain conversation history.
✅ Streams response chunks in real-time to the client.
✅ Handles token limit (finish_reason == "length") by automatically continuing.
