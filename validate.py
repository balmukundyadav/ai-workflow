I am creating multi agent llm application where main agent is supervisor and that has team of three agents log search agent, infra monitoring and data management agent, could you please help me with perfect system prompts that will be effective for multiple agents application 


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a set of highly effective system prompts for a multi-agent LLM architecture where a Supervisor Agent orchestrates three specialized agents:

1. Supervisor Agent – System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Supervisor Agent managing a team of expert agents. Your role is to analyze user requests, identify the appropriate agent(s) to handle them, and coordinate the response workflow. Ensure responses are accurate, well-structured, and utilize the strengths of your team.

Team Agents:
1. Log Search Agent – Expert in querying and interpreting system, application, and model logs.
2. Infra Monitoring Agent – Monitors infrastructure health, usage, and performance (CPU, memory, disk, etc.).
3. Data Management Agent – Manages datasets, storage, schema, metadata, and data transformations.

You MUST:
- Parse the user's input to determine intent.
- Delegate tasks clearly to one or more agents.
- Summarize and combine their responses for the user.
- Maintain context across turns.
- Handle ambiguous or multi-part questions by decomposing them and directing sub-tasks accordingly.

Only respond directly if the request is general or high-level and does not require specialist intervention.
2. Log Search Agent – System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Log Search Agent, an expert in querying, filtering, and analyzing logs from systems, applications, and machine learning models. You specialize in identifying issues, root causes, error traces, anomalies, and run-level diagnostics using log data.

You MUST:
- Respond to specific log-related queries using parameters like run ID, time range, service/model names, and keywords.
- Clearly explain what logs indicate, especially for failures, timeouts, or unexpected behavior.
- Summarize findings concisely, suggesting possible root causes if applicable.
- Be capable of dealing with both structured (e.g., Azure Log Analytics, Kibana) and unstructured logs.

Assume the user query has been refined for you by the Supervisor Agent.
3. Infra Monitoring Agent – System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Infra Monitoring Agent, responsible for tracking and analyzing infrastructure metrics. This includes monitoring CPU, memory, disk usage, network activity, VM or container health, and alert thresholds.

You MUST:
- Respond to status requests about specific components or services.
- Identify performance bottlenecks, failures, or alerts.
- Suggest actions when thresholds are breached.
- Provide recent metrics summaries with contextual interpretation (e.g., "CPU usage was 98% for the past hour due to XYZ").

All insights must be actionable and based on available metric patterns or alerts.
4. Data Management Agent – System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Data Management Agent, responsible for managing datasets, metadata, data schemas, storage details, and transformations.

You MUST:
- Help locate, describe, or summarize datasets based on user input.
- Track data lineage, versioning, schema changes, and storage locations.
- Respond to queries about dataset structure, availability, and permissions.
- Assist with data cleaning, formatting, and transformation needs.

When asked about missing or inconsistent data, provide explanations and offer remediation suggestions.
Would you like me to generate a LangChain or LangGraph setup for wiring these agents together next?







You said:
Thanks, you are super intelligent prompt creator assistant your task is to make above prompts best in class 
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the kind words! Here's the refined, best-in-class version of your system prompts — polished for clarity, tone, precision, and maximum agent performance in a multi-agent LLM environment. These are structured for top-tier results in frameworks like LangGraph, LangChain, or any custom orchestrator.

1. Supervisor Agent – Refined System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Supervisor Agent in a multi-agent LLM system. Your role is to intelligently coordinate a team of specialized agents to fulfill complex user queries with accuracy, clarity, and efficiency.

Team Members:
1. Log Search Agent – Expert in analyzing system, application, and ML model logs.
2. Infra Monitoring Agent – Specialist in infrastructure health and performance metrics.
3. Data Management Agent – Authority on dataset management, metadata, schemas, and storage.

Your Responsibilities:
- Act as the central brain of the system: interpret user queries, determine intent, and assign subtasks to the most appropriate agents.
- If a query spans multiple domains, decompose it into discrete tasks and route each to the right agent(s).
- Aggregate, refine, and summarize agent responses into a unified, helpful output.
- Maintain context and conversation history to guide agent collaboration effectively.
- Only respond directly when the query is general or supervisory in nature.

Your goal: Ensure expert-level responses while keeping the interaction natural and human-like.
2. Log Search Agent – Refined System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Log Search Agent — a domain expert in retrieving and interpreting logs from infrastructure, applications, and machine learning pipelines.

Your Capabilities:
- Query logs based on identifiers such as run ID, timestamp, service or model name, or error keyword.
- Diagnose system issues, model failures, performance bottlenecks, or anomalies by analyzing log patterns.
- Surface relevant log excerpts and provide human-readable summaries of what they imply.
- Suggest possible root causes or follow-up actions based on log insights.

Assume the user’s query has been pre-processed by the Supervisor Agent to focus your attention.

Your responses must be:
- Precise and technical, yet easy to understand.
- Focused on actionable insights, not just raw log data.
- Clear about uncertainty when applicable.
3. Infra Monitoring Agent – Refined System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Infra Monitoring Agent — a specialist in real-time infrastructure monitoring and analysis.

Your Expertise:
- Monitor and report on CPU, memory, disk I/O, network usage, and overall VM or container health.
- Detect threshold breaches, degradation patterns, or failures across services and resources.
- Analyze trends and identify performance bottlenecks.
- Recommend remediation actions when performance metrics exceed safe levels.

Inputs will be specific metrics, time ranges, or component identifiers routed to you by the Supervisor Agent.

Your output should:
- Include a concise summary of the metric state (e.g., "CPU usage spiked to 95% for 30 minutes").
- Explain root causes and contextual factors where possible.
- Highlight alerts and risks, with clarity and urgency where needed.
4. Data Management Agent – Refined System Prompt
plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are the Data Management Agent — an expert in handling dataset discovery, metadata, schema evolution, and storage operations.

Your Role:
- Assist in locating datasets based on partial or full descriptions.
- Summarize dataset metadata (e.g., schema, size, location, version, source, freshness).
- Explain data lineage, versioning changes, or schema differences across environments.
- Offer transformation suggestions (cleaning, formatting, type casting) when requested.
- Report on storage usage, availability, and access permissions.

The Supervisor Agent will provide context-rich requests that focus your scope.

Your responses must be:
- Technically accurate, yet user-friendly.
- Structured for both human consumption and downstream automation (e.g., tabular metadata or JSON if needed).
- Proactive in identifying data quality or consistency issues and offering solutions.
If you're wiring these into a system (LangGraph, LangChain Router, or a custom controller), I can help you define:

Agent functions

def create_prompt(system_message: str):
    return ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", system_message),
        ("human", "{input}")
    ])
Step 3: Define Prompts for Each Agent
python
Copy
Edit
SUPERVISOR_PROMPT = """You are the Supervisor Agent... [include the full refined Supervisor prompt here]"""
LOG_SEARCH_PROMPT = """You are the Log Search Agent... [full refined version]"""
INFRA_MONITOR_PROMPT = """You are the Infra Monitoring Agent... [full refined version]"""

supervisor_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=create_prompt(SUPERVISOR_PROMPT))
log_search_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=create_prompt(LOG_SEARCH_PROMPT))
infra_monitor_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=create_prompt(INFRA_MONITOR_PROMPT))
data_mgmt_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=create_prompt(DATA_MANAGEMENT_PROMPT))
Step 4: Define State and Nodes in LangGraph
python
Copy
Edit
from typing import TypedDict, Literal, Union

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    input: str
    result: str
    agent: Literal["log_search", "infra_monitor", "data_mgmt", "end"]

# Define agent node wrappers

def data_mgmt_node(state: AgentState):
    result = data_mgmt_chain.run(input=state["input"])
    return {"input": state["input"], "result": result, "agent": "end"}
Step 5: Build and Compile the Graph
python
Copy
Edit
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)

builder.add_node("supervisor", supervisor_node)
builder.add_node("log_search", log_search_node)
builder.add_node("infra_monitor", infra_monitor_node)
builder.add_node("data_mgmt", data_mgmt_node)

builder.set_entry_point("supervisor")

builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "supervisor",
    lambda state: state["agent"],
    {
        "log_search": "log_search",
        "infra_monitor": "infra_monitor",
        "data_mgmt": "data_mgmt",
        "end": END
    }
)

builder.add_edge("log_search", END)
builder.add_edge("infra_monitor", END)
builder.add_edge("data_mgmt", END)

graph = builder.compile()
Step 6: Run the Graph
python
Copy
Edit
response = graph.invoke({"input": "Why did the model fail during deployment yesterday?"})
print(response["result"])
Would you like:

Memory integration for context across interactions?

You said:
Here each teams expert agents have specific tools and these agents are running as fastapi restful services the please update the code and create full fledged code application 
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Perfect. Since your specialized agents are running as FastAPI RESTful services with specific tools, the Supervisor Agent will need to call their APIs dynamically based on user intent.

Here’s a complete, full-fledged implementation of your LangGraph-based app where:

The Supervisor agent uses an LLM to analyze user queries.

It calls the appropriate REST API (FastAPI microservice) for each expert agent.

Agent responses are returned and summarized to the user.

You said:
Please recreate all the prompts that is suitable for langgraph create_supervisor and expert team members
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a refined and production-grade set of system prompts tailored for your LangGraph multi-agent architecture, featuring a Supervisor Agent and three expert team agents:

1. Supervisor Agent Prompt
python
Copy
Edit
SUPERVISOR_PROMPT = """
You are the Supervisor Agent responsible for orchestrating a team of specialized agents. Your job is to read the user query and determine which expert agent should handle it. Each agent is a FastAPI service accessible via an API call.

Here are the agents and their responsibilities:

1. **Log Search Agent** (`log_search`) — Specializes in identifying errors, tracing run failures, and searching application or infrastructure logs.
2. **Infrastructure Monitoring Agent** (`infra_monitor`) — Monitors CPU, memory, disk usage, uptime, and detects system bottlenecks or anomalies.
3. **Data Management Agent** (`data_mgmt`) — Manages datasets, schemas, storage metadata, and handles data quality or availability issues.

Instructions:
- Analyze the user query and choose **one** agent.
- Your response must be one of the following exact strings: `log_search`, `infra_monitor`, or `data_mgmt`.
- Do not add explanations. Just return the agent name.
"""
2. Log Search Agent Prompt
python
Copy
Edit
LOG_SEARCH_PROMPT = """
You are the Log Search Agent. You specialize in searching, interpreting, and summarizing application and infrastructure logs.

You can:
- Search logs based on identifiers (run ID, timestamp, error keyword).
- Identify and explain errors, anomalies, or failure traces.
- Summarize log data with root cause analysis.
- Query logs from external systems like Azure Log Analytics or ELK.

Always provide clear, concise diagnostics. If no results are found, suggest relevant log filters or keywords.
"""
3. Infrastructure Monitoring Agent Prompt

I am streaming llm response with gpt-4o at certain point response got stop due to finish reason length, i would like continue response when length reason reached, could please write python code for the same 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You can handle this by detecting when the finish_reason is "length" and making a follow-up request to continue from where the response left off. Here’s a Python implementation using OpenAI’s API:

Implementation
python
Copy
Edit
import openai

def stream_llm_response(prompt, model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=1024):
    """
    Stream LLM response and handle continuation if stopped due to length.
    """
    full_response = ""
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

    while True:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            stream=True  # Enable streaming
        )

        chunk_text = ""
        finish_reason = None

        for chunk in response:
            if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.get("content"):
                text_part = chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]
                chunk_text += text_part
                print(text_part, end="", flush=True)  # Stream output live

            finish_reason = chunk.choices[0].finish_reason if chunk.choices else None

        full_response += chunk_text

        # If stopped due to length, continue response
        if finish_reason == "length":
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": chunk_text})
        else:
            break  # Stop if it's a normal completion

    return full_response

# Example Usage
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
response = stream_llm_response(prompt_text)
Explanation
The function makes an initial request to GPT-4o with streaming enabled.
If the response stops due to "length", it appends the partial response to the message history and continues generating more text.
This loop continues until the full response is obtained.
Let me know if you need modifications!







You said:
Will it continue to return chunk responses as well to client or only rerun full response at once
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The current implementation streams responses chunk by chunk to the client while handling the continuation seamlessly. It ensures that:

The response is streamed in real-time.
If the finish_reason is "length", a new request is made with the previous response as context, continuing the generation.
It continues streaming each chunk from the new request instead of waiting for the full response.
So, it does not rerun the entire response at once—it keeps streaming as new chunks arrive. Let me know if you need refinements!







You said:
Could you please make it similar to chatgpt how chatgpt handle such case on length 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To handle the response streaming like ChatGPT itself, you can modify the implementation to continuously request more tokens when finish_reason is "length", ensuring a seamless continuation. Below is an optimized version that maintains streaming behavior while handling token limits like ChatGPT.

Implementation (ChatGPT-like Handling)
python
Copy
Edit
import openai

def stream_llm_response(prompt, model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=1024):
    """
    Stream LLM response and handle continuation if stopped due to length.
    This function mimics ChatGPT's behavior by continuing until completion.
    """
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    full_response = ""

    while True:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            stream=True  # Enable streaming
        )

        chunk_text = ""
        finish_reason = None

        for chunk in response:
            if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.get("content"):
                text_part = chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]
                chunk_text += text_part
                full_response += text_part
                print(text_part, end="", flush=True)  # Stream to client in real-time

            finish_reason = chunk.choices[0].finish_reason if chunk.choices else None

        # If response stopped due to length, continue from where it left off
        if finish_reason == "length":
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": chunk_text})
        else:
            break  # Exit loop when response completes naturally

    return full_response

# Example Usage
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
response = stream_llm_response(prompt_text)
How This Works (Similar to ChatGPT Behavior)
Streams Response in Real-Time
Each chunk is printed live (print(text_part, end="", flush=True)).
Handles Token Limit Exceeding (finish_reason == "length")
If the response stops due to length, the assistant’s last response is stored in messages, and a new request is made to continue from where it left off.
No Repetition or Restart
The continuation starts exactly from the last point, avoiding re-generating previous text.
This closely mimics how ChatGPT itself handles long responses when streaming. Let me know if you need further refinements!







You said:
Here you are print chunks but what if client need to get chunks to display in ui
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the client needs to receive streamed chunks for UI display, you can use a Python generator. This allows real-time chunk delivery while handling continuation seamlessly, similar to ChatGPT.

Implementation: Stream Chunks to Client (Like ChatGPT)
python
Copy
Edit
import openai

def stream_llm_chunks(prompt, model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=1024):
    """
    Stream LLM response chunks to the client while handling length-based continuation.
    This mimics ChatGPT's streaming behavior.
    """
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

    while True:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=messages,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
            stream=True  # Enable streaming
        )

        chunk_text = ""
        finish_reason = None

        for chunk in response:
            if chunk.choices and chunk.choices[0].delta.get("content"):
                text_part = chunk.choices[0].delta["content"]
                chunk_text += text_part
                yield text_part  # Send chunk to client UI in real-time

            finish_reason = chunk.choices[0].finish_reason if chunk.choices else None

        # If response stopped due to length, continue from where it left off
        if finish_reason == "length":
            messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": chunk_text})
        else:
            break  # Exit loop when response completes naturally

# Example Usage: Simulating client receiving chunks
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
for chunk in stream_llm_chunks(prompt_text):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)  # Simulating UI streaming display
How This Works
Uses yield to Stream Chunks
Instead of printing, it yields each chunk so the client can process it in real-time.
Handles Token Limit Exceeding (finish_reason == "length")
If the response stops due to length, it continues seamlessly.
Can Be Used in Web Frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django, etc.)
This function can be plugged into a FastAPI or Flask endpoint to stream responses to a front-end UI.
Example: FastAPI Endpoint to Stream Response
If you are building a web app, you can integrate this with FastAPI for real-time streaming:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/stream")
def stream_response(prompt: str):
    return StreamingResponse(stream_llm_chunks(prompt), media_type="text/plain")
Client-Side (JavaScript Fetch Example)
If your UI is in JavaScript/React:

javascript
Copy
Edit
async function fetchResponse() {
    const response = await fetch("/stream?prompt=Explain the theory of relativity");
    const reader = response.body.getReader();
    const decoder = new TextDecoder();

    while (true) {
        const { value, done } = await reader.read();
        if (done) break;
        console.log(decoder.decode(value)); // Append to UI
    }
}
Final Thoughts
This implementation is efficient, real-time, and seamless—it delivers LLM chunks without waiting for the full response, and continues automatically when length is exceeded.

Let me know if you need refinements!







You said:
Thanks, could you please rewrite the above code using langgraph 
ChatGPT said:

# Example Usage: Simulating client receiving chunks
prompt_text = "Explain the theory of relativity in detail."
for chunk in stream_response(prompt_text):

How This Works
Uses LangGraph to Manage State
Tracks conversation history (ChatState).
Streams Response in Real-Time (yield)
Chunks are sent to the client immediately.
Handles Length-Based Continuation (finish_reason == "length")
Automatically re-calls GPT-4o if the response cuts off.
Scalable for UI & Web Apps
Can be integrated with FastAPI for real-time streaming.
Example: FastAPI Streaming Endpoint
You can integrate this with FastAPI for a web-based chatbot.

python
Copy
Edit
